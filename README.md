# KelimeOyunu

The game that I created in my first year in the university. I tried to learn some Python. I created this game in the terminale. So this is actually my first project. Basic word game. Player should write the word start with the letter which is the last letter of computer's word. You can get used to it when you start. This game uses a dictionary which is Turkish. If you want you can make some slight changes and convert it to another languages. See you.
